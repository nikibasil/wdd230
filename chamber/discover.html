                <h2>Cathedral Rock National Park</h2>

                <p>Rock-hopping isn't just for the wallaroos at Cathedral Rock National Park. Hike to the park's main
                    boulder piles of Woolpack Rocks and Cathedral Rock and scramble to their summits. Then enjoy the
                    superb views across the wilderness landscape of dry eucalypt forest and granite outcrops. The park's
                    rock formations are particularly photogenic in late-afternoon light or mist.

                    Whether you're visiting the park for a picnic lunch or camping for a few days, there are plenty of
                    birdwatching opportunities. The screech of the glossy black cockatoo lets you know there's a flock
                    overhead. You may be fortunate enough to spot the endangered turquoise parrot, and remember to look
                    out for the wedge-tailed eagle silently circling the granite tors.

                <h2>Gostwyck Chapel</h2>
                <p>All Saints Anglican Church or better known as Gostwyck Chapel is part of Gostwyck Station only 11km
                    east of Uralla along Tourist Drive 19. This quaint little church can also be accessed from the
                    Waterfall Way east of Armidale.

                    Edward Gostwyck Cory settled this holding of 80,000 acres in 1832 and named it Gostwyck. In 1934 he
                    sold his grazing rights to William Dangar who subsequently sold them to his brother Henry. The
                    Dangars are quite a renowned family in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley area.


                    The Chapel at Gostwyck was officially named All Saints Anglican Church and erected on Gostwyck
                    Station. The chapel was built in memory of Major Clive Dangar who died of injuries sustained during
                    World War 1. He made it back to Australia but died in Melbourne as a result of these wounds received
                    during the war and is buried in Waverely Cemetery in Sydney.

                <h2>Waterfall Way</h2>
                <p>It's a picturesque drive, and it's called Waterfall Way for a reason. It passes incredible nature
                    sites, including Round Mountain
                    - the highest mountain in the region. It also connects the Great Dividing Range and the Pacific
                    Highway along the coast.
                    It passes through seven national parks, three UNESCO World Heritage sites, and through rainforests
                    and, of course, waterfalls.
